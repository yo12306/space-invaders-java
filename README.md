## About the Project

This project is an exploration of my skills and knowledge in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and graphical user interface (GUI) development using Java, specifically with the `java swing` package. My intention with this project is to test and refine my understanding of OOP concepts while creating a fun and engaging game.

## Features

- **OOP Principles:** The project is designed following fundamental OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Java Swing GUI:** The graphical user interface is built using the `java swing` package.
